Phillip -- Is the value axis on Sheet 2 of the "socalprices" spread sheet 
supposed to be in $? If so, are they the right values (millions?) and where 
did they come from? I can't relate them to the Sheet 1 spread sheet.
As I told Mike, we will file this out-of-time tomorrow as a supplement to our 
comments today along with a cover letter. We have to fully understand the 
charts and how they are constructed, and we ran out of time today. It's much 
better to file an out-of-time supplement to timely comments than to file the 
whole thing late, particuarly since this is apparently on such a fast track.
Thanks.

beginning to fall in response these market responses.
