Hello  All,
I want to see who  will be able to golf on Friday and Saturday.
Friday we will golf  here in San Antonio and everything is taken care of already.  It will be at  the Quarry and I think the times are between 8 adn 8:30 am. 
Saturday we will  golf at the Shreiner Public Golf Course and we have a tee time at 8am and  8:07am.  Fee for this this one I believe is  $33.00/person.
 
So far this is who I  have for golf on Friday:
1. Me(of  course)
2. JD  Tamez
3. Henry  Glasgow
4. Colin  Murphy
5.  .....
 
For Saturday, we  have the following so far:
1.  Me(hopefully)
2. Jim  Thierheimer
3. Tom  Thierheimer
4. Steve  Levine
5. Sean  Wolfe
6. Armando  Martinez
7. Vince  Martinez
8........
 
E-mail me back if  you are going to be able and we'll get you on for sure.  I am sure looking  forward to  seeing everyone for Teri and mine's big day.  It will  be even more beautiful with all of your there.
 
Talk to you  soon!!
