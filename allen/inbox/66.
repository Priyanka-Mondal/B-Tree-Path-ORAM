date tue  nov   - pstcc tim.orourkeenron.com yevgeny.frolovenron.combcc tim.orourkeenron.com yevgeny.frolovenron.commichellehere are my very minor comments. however we still need to wait on any additions based on meeting with smes today. one concern is the firing of the learner who performs bad in the final two scenarios. do we face any copyright issues using the cnn type themes in addition i think we need to stay clear of anything that remotely seems like california or anything that really happen with enron i.e. so-cal waha in addition comments on regulatory issues may be a problem i.e. california legislature.sheriwhen you read all the scripts together and due to the similar mechanics being taught it appears very repetitious. thus i do believe we need to maybe use a dateline type theme for one and a  minute type theme for another scenario vice just the cnn type theme. in the last two scenarios can we include a promotion out of the associate program for the stellar performers i.e. title change to manager  cheers kirk---------------------- forwarded by kirk mcdanielhouees on   am ---------------------------kirk mcdaniel  amcc tim orourkeenronenronxgate yevgeny frolovenronenronxgate mery.l.brownaccenture.com laura.a.de.la.torreaccenture.com donald.l.barnhartaccenture.com michellethanks for your support of the brm project. here are the remaining scripts. tim and i will review them too and forward our comments to you. any feedback on the first two scripts again thankscheerskirk---------------------- forwarded by kirk mcdanielhouees on   am ---------------------------sheri.a.righiaccenture.com on   pmcc mery.l.brownaccenture.com laura.a.de.la.torreaccenture.com donald.l.barnhartaccenture.com kirk -i have combined all of the storyline scripts intro and scenarios - foryou to send to legal for their review. your comments were incorporated inthe scripts for scenarios  and . we decided to refer to the company asboth energy incorporated and energy inc. rather than using e.i. so thatthere is no confusion with enron international. we will not have a coachexit for scenario  until eod tomorrow after the ed meeting. in referenceto your concern over locking in a price as collusion those werephillips words but we hope legal will decide if we need to change them.please let me know if you have any questions.see attached file rm simulation - intro  scenarios -.docsheri a. righiaccenturehuman performance service linehartford - one financial plazadirect dial   vpn  octel  e-mail sheri.a.righiaccenture.comthis message is for the designated recipient only and may containprivileged proprietary or otherwise private information. if you havereceived it in error please notify the sender immediately and delete theoriginal. any other use of the email by you is prohibited. - rm simulation - intro  scenarios -.doc
