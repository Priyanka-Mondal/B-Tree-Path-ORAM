date sat  dec   - pstcc k..allenenron.combcc k..allenenron.comphillipcould you please e-mail me the draw file you created for bishops corner. iwas working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it i shouldjust have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.also i need the vendor payee list that you created for the land and softcosts. i need to re-format it by draw number and to the bank one format andagain it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers tosee if you agree. land and soft costs - initial draw  . galaxy - draw    . galaxy - draw    . total paid to date cash  . project cost  . loan amount  . equity required  . developer profit   . balance of funding  . total paid to date  . balance to fund cash  . galaxy - draw    . bank one draw    . final cash funding  .i think you thought you had more to fund. however i do not see that youaccounted for the cash portion of the developer fee that you paid cis. am ilooking at this right please let me know and attach the files discussedabove. i am working all day monday so i hope i can get it before then ifpossible.thanks a lotgreg thorse
