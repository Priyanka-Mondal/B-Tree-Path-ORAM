date wed  oct   - pdtphillip there are a number of alternative systems that will allow the samelevel of energy efficiency. i would wait a bit for winks bid though. yousay that your panel costs are  additional. that sounds like a lot. ijust did a panel house with a  sq ft footprint and the total panel costwas about  with  inch walls and  inch roof. stay in touch and wecan discuss alternatives if that becomes necessary. if your budget is -per sq. ft. excluding land costs your costs will be on the low end of thetrue custom home level but should be achievable with good management.richard morganmanager green building programaustin energy barton springs rd.austin tx -ph. ..fax ..e-mail richard.morganaustinenergy.comrichardi spoke to you earlier this week with questions about building withsips. i am planning to build a home in san marcos as soon as i candecide on a builder and materials. i already have my blueprintscompleted. what i took from our conversation was to use the sips with. roof panels and use a metal roof.i have been working with johnnie brown a builder from san antonio thatis also a creative panel rep. the problem is that i have a budget of-sf and it does not appear that he will be able to stay withinthat budget. i dont want to settle for a conventional stick builthouse. i was wondering about alternatives. would some combination of aradiant barrier and non-cfc spray insulation provide close to the sameenergy savings at a lower cost than sips. for example i just spoke toa sales rep for demilec. he will spray foam insulation at .sf.that would be approximately  compared to over  additionalcosts for the panels. but would the foam insulation be as effectivedo you have any suggestions of materials or contractors that would helpme construct the best home for the money. i am trying to get a bid fromwink with premier based on you reference.thank you for your help.phillip allenpallenenron.com--this e-mail is the property of enron corp. andor its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient s. any review use distribution or disclosure byothers is strictly prohibited. if you are not the intended recipient orauthorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or replyto enron corp. at enron.messaging.administrationenron.com and delete allcopies of the message. this e-mail and any attachments hereto are notintended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence abinding and enforceable contract between enron corp. or any of itsaffiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not berelied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise.thank you.
