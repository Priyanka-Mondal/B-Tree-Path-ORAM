date tue  nov   - pstphillip the insurancerepairs numbers are actually overstated they are based on calculations from uspsl owners and agents like us who have helped clients buy and sell post offices for years. with regards to the exercising of renewal options you might be interested to know that the usps actually renews these  of the time some post offices are in the  years and above range on leases. and finally the construction costs are reflective of the construction codes and practices the usps requires for contractors. these are well-built facilities last a long time and can be converted to many other uses if the post office moves out.i have added another post office for your consideration. its in mcallen is a multi-tenant building and has a fairly strong cap rate. the flyer is attached.in any case i would be glad to help you look for other investment possibilities over here. do let me know what youve already found and what you might like to find. i look forward to hearing from you. with best regards jim willsphillip.k.allenenron.com wrote jim your spreadsheet shows the same type of return i was calculating. your insurance and repair numbers seem very low. also assuming that the options to extend at higher rates will be exercised is a huge leap of faith. i dont believe these properties cost any where near the sf that they are being offered at. based on the optimistic back loaded returns i would not be comfortable purchasing a post office at this time. thank you anyway. phillip phillip hope you are doing well this week and have great plans for turkeyday well be with family in austin and kind of on a maiden voyage in our  avion that were upgrading for camping heres a look at three post offices in a slightly different manner. remember that the roma one is about  years old was a  yr lease originally. the other two are new. the roma is like buying a savings account. it would be paid off in  years you would reap some cash flow during that period then the bonus kicks in after that with the  yr. renewals at a higher lease income after its paid off. it would probably go beyond another  years. cash on cash returns dont mean as much on shorter amoritazations like roma. we have shown this info and flyers to several people so do let us know if you are interested in any of them...i really dont think they will last long. with best regards jim wills this e-mail is the property of enron corp. andor its relevant affiliate and may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient s. any review use distribution or disclosure by others is strictly prohibited. if you are not the intended recipient or authorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or reply to enron corp. at enron.messaging.administrationenron.com and delete all copies of the message. this e-mail and any attachments hereto are not intended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence a binding and enforceable contract between enron corp. or any of its affiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not be relied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise. thank you. - mcallen.wps.doc
