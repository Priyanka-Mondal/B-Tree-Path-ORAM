thursday evening in la. in attendance were ken lay the governor the governors staff director kari dohn and myself. the gov. spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his ideas. he would like some additional thoughts from us by tuesday of next week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following monday. attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed based on my discussions with several of you as well as some background materials jeff dasovich and i prepared. below are my notes from the meeting regarding our proposals the governors ideas as well as my overview of the situation based on the governors commentsoverview we made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing communication with his administration. the gov does not want the utilities to go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief more modest than what the utilities are looking for and credit guarantees. his staff has more work to do on the latter but he was clearly intrigued with the idea. he talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail level. he also wants to use what generation he has control over for the benefit of california consumers including utility-owned generation which he would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis and excess muni power which he estimates at mw. he foresees a mix of market oriented solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix the problem by  and provide some political cover.our proposals i have attached the outline we put in front of him it also included the forward price information several of you provided. he seemed interested in  the buy down of significant demand  the state setting a goal of x mw of new generation by a date certain  getting the utilities to gradually buy more power forward and  setting up a group of rate analysts and other nonadvocates to develop solutions to a number of issues including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities. he was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding ldc gas purchases. as already mentioned he was also favorably disposed to finding some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.his ideas the gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously under serious consideration and some of which were mere brainstorming. some of these ideas would require legislative action.state may build or make buildtransfer arrangements a couple of generation plants. the gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases. this was a frequently recurring theme.utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus basis to consumers.municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in california.state universities including uccsu and the community colleges would more widely deploy distributed generation.expand in-state gas production.take state lands gas royalties in kind.negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for addtional gas supplies.empower an existing state agency to approvecoordinate power plant maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at any one time.condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.either eliminate the iso or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear more about how nordpool worksjeff- someone in schroeders group should be able to help out here.wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state. we made some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control approach with generators.securitize uncollected power purchase costs.to dos jeff again id like to prevail on you to assemble the groups thoughts and get them to karihe wants to see  year fixed power prices for peak off-peak and baseload -- not just the  one year strips.he wants comments on his proposals by tuesday.he would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the deal.he wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the forward contracting issues.thanks to everyone for their help. we made some progress today.
