date mon  jan   - pstjeffthat is good news about leander. now for the stage. i would like to get it sold by the end of march. i have about k invested in the stagecoach  it looks like i need to get around k to breakeven. i dont need the cash out right now so if i could get a personal guarantee and jaques craig can work out the partnership transfer i would definitely be willing to carry a second lien. i understand second liens are going for -.checkout this spreadsheet.these numbers should get the place sold in the next fifteen minutes. however i am very concerned about the way it is being shown. having lucy show it is not a good idea. i need you to meet the buyers and take some trips over to get more familar with the property. my dad doesnt have the time and i dont trust lucy or wade to show it correctly. i would prefer for you to show it from now on. i will have the operating statements complete through december by this friday. phillip
