date fri  oct   - pdtdont know if you saw this already. interesting.kenindigestion daniel fisher forbes magazine .. all those new natural gas-fired electric plants mean more gas demand right maybe not.for natural gas bulls there was never a surer sign of good times to come than the order book at general electric corp. backlogs in ges power systems group almost tripled to  billion in the late s as scores of utilities and freestanding power producers ordered natural gas turbines to supply the nations growing appetite for electricity. gas demand had to go up as all those shiny new turbines were connected to the grid. ah but there was a flaw in that argument--one that is becoming glaringly clear as the price of gas plunges below  per million btu at the wellhead from as high as  last year. a million btu of gas equals just about  cubic feet. those new gas plants were supposed to steal business from pollution-spewing coal units which still supply half the nations electricity. but in a painstaking study of  power plants that supply the bulk of u.s. electricity charles studness president of studness research found quite the opposite could happen. studness determined that  of the new electricity supplied to the grid over the past five years came from existing plants mostly coal-fired units. and theres plenty more where that came from. studness figures existing coal plants have the potential to increase output by  million megawatt-hours a year for the next five years representing about half the expected .-a-year increase in demand. coals advantage over gas its cheap. utilities paid an average of . per million btu for coal last year compared with . for gas delivered. even with depressed gas prices many coal plants are still cheaper to operate. so while those new turbines being installed by calpine nyse cpn - news - people and other independent power producers see table below will burn a lot of gas they will do it mostly at the expense of older gas plants that burn half again as much.  addressing a burning issue if natural gas prices stay down or merely remain volatile it will help companies that burn trade or store gas and hurt those that sell it or provide equipment to the industry. overleveraged gas producers and service companies could have trouble making it through the downturn.  winners sales bil remarks calpine . its gas power plants wont compete with coal for years chesapeake energy . hedged gas production through december  dynegy . owns gas coal power plants stores trades gas peabody energy . worlds largest coal company losers sales bil remarks devon energy . gas-heavy  billion in ...debt general electric . sells gas turbines pioneer natural resources . . billion in ...debt  of production is gas transocean sedcoforex .  billion in debt heavy gas-drilling exposure  latest  months. source market guide via factset research systems. its not our game to compete with coal or nuclear says ron a. walter senior vice president of san jose calif.-based calpine which plans over the next few years to build gas-fired plants totaling  megawatts. its our game to displace older gas. combined-cycle gas turbines which use hot exhaust gases from one turbine to generate steam to turn a second one can transform  btu of gas into a kilowatt-hour of electricity enough to light one lightbulb for ten hours. the oldest gas plants burn as much as  btu and the national average is . substitute enough new plants for old and u.s. gas consumption currently  billion cubic feet a day could drop by as much as  billion cubic feet a day. that scenario sounds unlikely to stephen bergstrom president of houston-based dynegy an energy-trading firm that also owns both coal- and gas-fired power plants. dynegys -year-old coal plants are huge capital hogs bergstrom says that cost ten times as much to maintain as modern gas units. throw in the cost of scrubbers and other required pollution controls and many smaller coal plants will have to be shut down bergstrom says. but coal-plant owners can be ingenious. witness midwest generation a nonregulated subsidiary of edison international that bought six coal plants from troubled commonwealth edison of chicago in . by changing operating procedures and burning a higher grade of coal midwest boosted output from the -year-old plants  last year--while reducing emissions. john long vice president and chief technical officer of the midwest generation unit thinks he can coax another  increase out of those aging boilers over the next five years without running afoul of environmental rules. long term the bullish scenario still holds gas will displace coal. in the meantime gas producers have a lot of bonds to retire.   borion
