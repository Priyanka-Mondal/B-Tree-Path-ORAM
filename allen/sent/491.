of february  . since then sce has instituted aprogram of cash conservation that includes suspension of certain obligationsand other measures.based on daily cash forecasts and cash conservation activities scesavailable cash improved through january  from an original estimate of .million to . billion. the actual cash flow given these cashconservation activities extends the cash depletion date.ii. credit relationshipshighlightssce has exercised all available lines of credit and has not been able toextend or renew credit as it has become due.at present there are no additional sources of credit open to sce.sces loan agreements provide for specific clauses with respect to default.generally these agreements provide for the debt becoming immediately due andpayable.sces utility plant assets are used to secure outstanding mortgage bondindebtedness although there is some statutory capacity to issue moreindebtedness if it were feasible to do so.credit ratings agencies have downgraded sces credit ratings on most of itsrated indebtedness from solid corporate ratings to below investment gradeissues within the last three weeks.iii. energy cost scenarioshighlightsthis report section uses different cpuc supplied assumptions to assessvarious price scenarios upon sces projected cash depletion dates. under suchscenarios sce would have a positive cash balance until march  .iv. cost containment initiativeshighlightssce has adopted a  million cost reduction plan for the year .the plan consists of an operation and maintenance component and a capitalimprovement component as follows in millionsoperating and maintenance costs  capital improvement costs total  the plan provides for up to  full part-time and contract positions tobe eliminated with approximately  of the total staff reduction coming fromcontract employees.under the plan capital improvement costs totaling  million are for themost part being deferred to a future date.sce dividends to its common shareholder and preferred stockholders andexecutive bonuses have been suspended resulting in an additional costsavings of approximately  million.v. accounting mechanisms to track stranded cost recovery tra and

facilities of million and accelerated revenues of  million.as of december   sce reported an undercollected balance in scestransition account tra of . billion.normally the generation memorandum

purchasing generation are tracked in the tra and revenues fromgeneration are tracked in the tcba. because these costs and revenues aretracked separately the net liability from procuring electric power asexpressed in the tra are overstated.turn proposalas part of our review the cpuc asked that we comment on the proposal of turnto change certain aspects of the regulatory accounting for transition assets.our comments are summarized as followsthe proposal would have no direct impact on the cash flows of sce in that itwould not directly generate nor use cash.the proposals impact on sces balance sheet would initially be to shiftcosts between two regulatory assets.turns proposal recognizes that because the costs of procuring power and therevenues from generating power are tracked separately the undercollection inthe tra is overstated.vi. flow of funds analysishighlightsin the last five years sce had generated net income of . billion and apositive cash flow from operations of  billion.during the same time period sce paid dividends and other distributions toits parent edison international of approximately . billion.edison international used the funds from dividends to pay

other corporate purposes.[there is no section vii]viii. earnings of california affiliatessces payments for power to its affiliates were approximately -million annually and remained relatively stable from  through .in  the payments increased by approximately  to over  million.this increase correlates to the increase in market pricesfor natural gas for the same period.a copy of the report is
