networks continued to aggressively implement its work plan to reduce its cost structure and streamline operations. the company is in the final stages of implementing a cost structure to drive break even at a quarterly revenue level well below us billion. the structure is expected to be in place in the first quarter of . frank dunn the companys new president and chief executive officer effective november   said nortel networks is focusing its investments and its organization to drive continued leadership across three businesses metro networks which encompasses metro optical networking ip networking ip services and voice over ip solutions for service providers and enterprises wireless networks and optical long haul networks. in the quarter our product programs continued to advance as we focused on building on our industry-leading portfolio of solutions. we also continued to work with our customers to help them plan and deploy the solutions that will position them to drive reductions in their cost of operations and enable them to take advantage of opportunities for new revenue streams. some key milestones over the past  days included -- the first north american ilec began the circuit to packet transition with the deployment of our carrier-grade softswitch -- announced metro dwdm wins in the united states europe and japan -- announced multiservice backbone awards atm ip mpls in china germany and asia -- continued progress on g wireless internet infrastructure deployments and completed the first commercial umts test calls and the first cdma x mobile ip call --

extremely pleased with the results that have been generated from our focus on cash management which drove a significant improvement in cash and contributed to positive cashflow from operations. in addition the company further increased its financial flexibility by completing a highly successful us. billion convertible debt issue which combined with positive operating cash performance from continuing operations and a significant reduction in short term debt has significantly enhanced our strong liquidity position. given the industry correction and actions we have taken over the last two quarters nortel networks balance sheet is well positioned. while we believe we are beginning to see early indications that capital spending by service providers is approaching sustainable levels it still remains difficult to predict. in light of this and the uncertainty regarding the potential impacts of events taking place in the wake of the september   tragedies and their effect on economies and businesses around the world we are not providing guidance for the fourth quarter of  or the full year  at this time concluded dunn. revenue breakdown from continuing operations network
