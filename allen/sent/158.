jay.reitmeyerenron.comcc m..tholtenron.combcc m..tholtenron.comattached is a summary of my notes at the socal meeting regarding revised window procedures. no hand-outs were provided.calculation of receipt point capacitytopock  mmcfdehrenberg  mmcfdneedles  mmcfdwheeler  mmcfdnew receipt pointskramer junction  mmcfdhector rd  mmcfdboth will be available around feb basis of pro-ration-current windows calculationcurrently gas control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system. gas select prorates interstates receipt capacity based on prior days nominations.new calculation changes and displaybased on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance. socal ist aking and applying the current formula for wheeler ridge to all the points. any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on gas select. customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts. operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections. demand forecast will rely on gas control weather forecast. they use weather bank as one of their tools.ofo declarationname changes from overnominationcan declare before any cycleprovide  hour noticepost on gas selectshow ofo calculation on gas selectwindowsreason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into systemcalculation based on noms which does not work well. lots of complaints. people were complaining that it restricted access to the system. eliminating point specific calculation. open system to max oper. limits or contractual limits. will continue to operate wheeler ridge under aug  procedures. no changes to wheeler ridge. due to the need to maintain operational control an ofo will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle. replace windows with operational maximum volumes. if cpuc approves comprehensive settlement will post  days of information to anticipate ofosnow customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.scheduling changes-nov gas select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid- . no direct dial-up. rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cyclecopy confirmed nomsall noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of rd party. however can still make changes. can still upload new files. hour noticesocal will provide  hour notice on gas select of ofo. other methods include leaving message on socal hotline -- and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers. gas select is official notification. courtesy notification is hot line and e mail. gas select is a subscriber- based system mandated by cpuc and must get regulatory change to make free.ofos are going to be system wide and not customer specific. ofos can be declared intraday. once ofo declared it will be kept for entire day. concerned that if call off will have to put back on. dont want to go back and forth. this decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works. many times socal see an increase of  mmcfday between cycle  and  so they are concerned. scheduled vs. capacity-declare ofonominations may not exceed  of expected usage. expected usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week. can revise expected usage.no interruptible storage injections allowed during ofo.use elapsed pro-rata rulesexpected usage-cut nominations to  of expected usage so will use same day of the prior week as proxy. generators need to revise expected usage. acceptance of changes are at the discretion of socal.flow day diversions dont go into effect until after cycle . gas control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed. if call ofo after cycle  or  and have interruptible storage injections such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised. if ofo called  interruptible storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as followscycle  nom    cutcycle  nom   cutcylce  nom   cutwindows will only be implemented during cycle  if ofo callled after cycle  and no improvement is realized. will allocate prorata. will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point. in other words if ofo declared during cycle  and no relief after  cycles socal will window cycle  and prorata cut. parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. for penalty purposes actual burn from  oclock to  oclock will be used to calculate penalties or maxdq if not metered. for ofo assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week. declare ofo on prior days scheduled
