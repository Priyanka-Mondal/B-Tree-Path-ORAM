date sun  dec   - pst cc phillip allen date sat  dec   -  phillip  could you please e-mail me the draw file you created for bishops corner. i was working on submitting it to you and rather then recreate it i should just have you send it back to me to fill in the new draw totals.  also i need the vendor payee list that you created for the land and soft costs. i need to re-format it by draw number and to the bank one format and again it would be easier to get it from you then to re-create it.  please take a look at the following summary and compare to your numbers to see if you agree.   land and soft costs - initial draw  .  galaxy - draw    .  galaxy - draw    .   total paid to date cash  .   project cost  .  loan amount  .   equity required  .  developer profit   .   balance of funding  .   total paid to date  .   balance to fund cash  .    galaxy - draw    .   bank one draw    .  final cash funding  .   i think you thought you had more to fund. however i do not see that you accounted for the cash portion of the developer fee that you paid cis. am i looking at this right please let me know and attach the files discussed above. i am working all day monday so i hope i can get it before then if possible.  thanks a lot  greg thorse       chat with friends online try msn messenger click here
