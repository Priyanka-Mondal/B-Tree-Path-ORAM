date wed  dec   - pstjim i would appreciate your help in locating financing for the project i described to you last week. the project is a  unit apartment complex in san marcos. there will be a builderdeveloper plus myself and possibly a couple of other investors involved. as i mentioned last week i would like to find interim financing land construction semi-perm that does not require the investors to personally guarantee. if there is a creative way to structure the deal i would like to hear your suggestions. one idea that has been mentioned is to obtain a forward commitment in order to reduce the equity required. i would also appreciate hearing from you how deals of this nature are normally financed. specifically the transition from interim to permanent financing. i could use a quick lesson in what numbers will be important to banks.  i am faxing you a project summary. and i will have the builderdeveloper email or fax his financial statement to you. let me know what else you need. the land is scheduled to close mid january.phillip allen
