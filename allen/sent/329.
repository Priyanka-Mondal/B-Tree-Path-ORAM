date tue  apr   - pdtfrankthe implied risk created by the san juan and rockies indeces being partially set after today is the same as the risk in a long futures position. whatever the risk was prior should not matter. since the rest of the books are very short price this should be a large offset. if the var calculation does not match the companys true risk then it needs to be revised or adjusted. phillip
