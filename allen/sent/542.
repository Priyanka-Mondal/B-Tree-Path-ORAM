date fri  dec   - pststevei am sending you a variety of charts with prices and operational detail. if you need to call with questions my home number is --.as far as recommendations here is a short list . examine ldcs incentive rate program. current methodology rewards sales above monthly index without enough consideration of future  replacement cost. the result is that the ldcs sell gas that should be injected into storage when daily prices run above the monthly index. this creates a shortage in later months. . california has the storage capacity and pipeline capacity to meet demand. investigate why it wasnt maximized operationally.  specific questions should include  . why in march -may  werent total system receipts higher in order to fill storage . why are there so many examples of ofos on weekends that push away too much gas from socals system.  i believe socal gas does an extremely poor job of forecasting their own demand. they repeatedly estimated they would receive more gas than their injection capablity but injected far less. . similar to the power market there is too much benchmarking to short term prices. not enough forward hedging is done by the major  ldcs. by design the customers are short at a floating rate. this market has been long historically. it has been a buyers market and the  consumer has benefitted. call me if you need any more input.phillip
