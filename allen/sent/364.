date wed  nov   - pstthanks. that is an interesting idea. id like to keep the rear stairwaybut that might still be possible. anyway lets see what happens with thevariance. i appreciate your efforts.by the way did you have any problems with any of the neighborsbob----- original message -----bobi turned in the application for a variance yesterday. the hearing will beon january th. in order to get on the calendar for the dec th hearingthe application had to be in by november th. i was under the impressionthat yesterday was the deadline. sorry if i dropped the ball.on another note i spoke to joe edwards yesterday and he had some usefulsuggestions about the addition. it might be possible to move the additionforward and open up the bedroom at the top of the stairs into the newspace. you could convert the modified bedroom into a media room and usethe new space for your gameplaymusic room. then you could close off theexisting play room to replace the bedroom lost. part of the play room thatis bordered by the stair rail and looks down to the living room could beused for a built in desk with a couple of computers. this way you wouldnot have to add a second staircase. the walls needed to convert theplayroom to a bedroom should be minor construction. in the back you couldslope the roof until you were within the setback. then you could place alarge dormer facing the back of the property or bring a wall straight up.from the driveway the addition would have the same elevation as yourdrawing but intwould be brought forward with a covered parking area belowthe addition. the kitchen and dining room windows would still open to thedriveway but they would be more shaded. that is the west side of the houseso that might not be a bad thing. your ideas about opening up the kitchento the living room or dining room would still be possible. personally ithink opening the dining room would be the better idea.i dont know if you can visualize this or if you are even interested inexploring anything except your original plan. but i wanted to suggestsomething in case the variance was not granted. let me know if you want meto try and sketch out these ideas.phillipthis e-mail is the property of enron corp. andor its relevant affiliate andmay contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of theintended recipient s. any review use distribution or disclosure byothers is strictly prohibited. if you are not the intended recipient orauthorized to receive for the recipient please contact the sender or replyto enron corp. at enron.messaging.administrationenron.com and delete allcopies of the message. this e-mail and any attachments hereto are notintended to be an offer or an acceptance and do not create or evidence abinding and enforceable contract between enron corp. or any of itsaffiliates and the intended recipient or any other party and may not berelied on by anyone as the basis of a contract by estoppel or otherwise.thank you.  borion
