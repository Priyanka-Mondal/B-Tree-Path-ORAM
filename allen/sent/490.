date wed  jan   - pstjeffbefore you write off the stage a few things to think about.. operating expenses include  of materials for maintenance and repairs. plus having a full time onsite maintenance man means no extra labor cost for repairs. there are only  units a lot of his time is spent on repairs.. what is an outside management firm going to do a full time onsite manager is all that is required. as i mentioned the prior manager has interest in returning. another alternative would be to hire a male manager that could do more make readies and lawn care. if you turn it over to a management company you could surely reduce the cost of a full time manager onsite.. considering     noi is not necessarily overstated. if you want to be ultra conservative use  at the lowest.. getting cash out is not a priority to me. so i am willing to structure this deal with minimum cash. a  note actually attractive. see below.my job just doesnt give me the time to manage this property. this property definitely requires some time but it has the return to justify the effort.sales price st lien nd lien transfer fee cash required noi st lien nd lien cash flow cash on cash these numbers are using the conservative noi if it comes in at k then cash on cash return would be more like . this doesnt reflect the additional profit opportunity of selling the property in the next few years for a higher price.do you want to reconsider let me know.phillip
