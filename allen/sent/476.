date tue  feb   - pstjeffmy target is to get  back out of the stage. therefore i could take a sales price of k and carry a second note of k. this would still only require k cash from the buyer. after broker fees and a title policy i would net around k cash. you can go ahead and negotiate with the buyer and strike the deal at  or higher with the terms described in the st email. do you want to give the new braunfels buyer a quick look at the deal.phillip
