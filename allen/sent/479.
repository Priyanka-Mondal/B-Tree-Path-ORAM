date mon  feb   - pst---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allenhouect on   am ---------------------------jeffrey c gossett  pmcc when we meet i would like to address the following issues. i had at least  people here past midnight on both nights and i have several people who have not left before  this week. . it is my understanding that susan was still booking new day deals on thursday night at  bc she did not get deal tickets from the trading floor until after  p.m.. it is also my understanding that susan is done with the pl and benchmark part of her book often times by  but that what keeps her here late is usually running numerous extra models and spreadsheets. one suggestion might be a permanent it person on this book. this was also my understanding from kyle etter who has left the company.i would like to get this resolved as soon as possible so that larry can get the information that he needs to be effective and so that we can run books like this and not lose good people.thankslarry mayenron  pmscotthouectect errol mclaughlincorpenronenroncc phillip k allenhouectect john arnoldhouectect as you might be aware susan scott the book admin for the pipe option book was forced by system problems to stay all night wednesday night and until  am friday in order to calc my book. while she is scheduled to rotate to the west desk soon i think we need to discuss putting two persons on my book in order to bring the work load to a sustainable level. id like to meet at  pm on monday to discuss this issue. please let me know if this time fits in your schedules.thankslarry
