date fri  feb   - pstlucyhere is a draft of a memo we should distribute to the units that are subject to caps. i wrote it as if it were from you. it should come from the manager.it is very important that we tell new tenants what the utility cap for there unit is when they move in. this needs to be written in on their lease.when you have to talk to a tenant complaining about the overages emphasize that it is only during the peak months and it is already warming up. have my dad read the memo before you put it out. you guys can make changes if you need to.next week we need to take inventory of all air conditioners and refrigerators. we have to get this done next week. i will email you a form to use to record serial numbers. the prospective buyers want this information plus we need it for our records. something to look forward to.it is  pm and i have to leave the office. please have my dad call me with the information about the units at home --. he will know what i mean.talk to you laterphillip
