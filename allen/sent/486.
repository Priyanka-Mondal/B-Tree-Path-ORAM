date fri  feb   - pstgeorgethe probability of building a house this year is increasing. i have shifted to a slightly different plan. there were too many design items that i could not work out in the plan we discussed previously. now i am leaning more towards a plan with two wings and a covered courtyard in the center. one wing would have a livingdining kitchen plus master bedroom downstairs with  kid bedrooms  a laundry room upstairs. the other wing would have a garage  guestroom downstairs with a game room  officeexercise room upstairs. this plan still has the same number of rooms as the other plan but with the courtyard and pool in the center this plan should promote more outdoor living. i am planning to orient the house so that the garage faces the west.  the center courtyard would be covered with a metal roof with some fiberglass skylights supported by metal posts. i am envisioning the two wings to have single slope roofs that are not connected to the center building. i dont know if you can imagine the house i am trying to describe. i would like to come and visit you again this month. if it would work for you i would like to drive up on sunday afternoon on feb.  around  or  pm. i would like to see the progress on the house we looked at and tour the one we didnt have time for. i can bring more detailed drawings of my new plan. call or email to let me know if this would work for you. pallenhotmail.com or --home --workphillip allenps. channel  in houston ran a story yesterday feb.  about a home in kingwood that had a poisonous strain of mold growing in the walls. you should try their website or call the station to get the full story. it would makes a good case for breathable walls.
