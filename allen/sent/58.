date mon  oct   - pdt---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allenhouect on   pm ---------------------------richard burchfield  amcc beth perlmanhouectect phillip below is the issues  to do list as we go forward with documenting the requirements for consolidated physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. what we need to focus on is the first bullet in allans list the need for a single set of requirements. although the meeting with keith on wednesday was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen will be extremely difficult and time consuming. throughout the meeting on wednesday keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking much like excel. what needs to happen on monday from  -  is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen this is critical. this does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. also to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physicalfinancial positions and transport trade capture. the other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to themselves and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this project.i have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been good. i believe there has been good communication between the teams but now we need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.richard ---------------------- forwarded by richard burchfieldhouect on   am ---------------------------allan severude  pmcc peggy alixhouectect russ seversonhouectect scott millshouectect kenny hahouectect from our initial set of meetings with the traders regarding consolidated positions i think we still have the following issueswe dont have a single point of contact from the trading group. weve had three meetings which brought out very different issues from different traders. we really need a single point of contact to help drive the trader requirements and help come to a consensus regarding the requirements.were getting hit with a lot of different requests many of which appear to be outside the scope of position consolidation.things left to doi think it may be useful to try to formulate a high level project goal to make it as clear as possible what were trying to accomplish with this project. itll help determine which requests fall under the project scope.go through the list of requests to determine which are in scope for this project and which fall out of scope.for those in scope work to define relative importance priority of each and work with traders to define the exact requirements of each.define the desired lay out of the position manager screen main view and all drill downs.use the above to formulate a project plan.things requested thus far no particular orderinclusion of sitara physical deals into the tds position manager and deal ticker.customized rows and columns in the position manager ad hoc rowscolumns that add up existing position manager rowscolumns.new drill down in the position manager to break out positions by physical transport swaps options ...addition of a curve tab to the position manager to show the real-time values of all curves on which the desk has a position.ability to split the current position grid to allow daily positions to be shown directly above monthly positions. each grouped column in the top grid would be tied to a grouped column in the bottom grid.ability to properly show curve shift for float-for-float deals determine the appropriate positions to show for eachgas daily for monthly indexphysical gas for nymexphysical gas for inside fercphysical gas for mid market.ability for tds to pull valuation results based on a tds flag instead of using official valuations.position and pl aggregation across all gas desks.ability to include the gas price book into tdsinclusion of spread options in our systems. ability to handle volatility skew and correlations.ability to revalue all options incrementally throughout the trading day. approximate delta changes between valuations using instantaneous gamma or a gamma grid.valuation of gas daily options.a new position screen for options months x strike x delta. tbd.inclusion of positions for exotic options currently managed in spreadsheets.ability to isolate the position change due to changed deals in the position manager.ability to view change deal pl in the tds deal ticker. show new deal terms prior deal terms and net pl affect of the change.eliminate change deals with no economic impact from the tds deal ticker.position drill down in the position manager to isolate the impact of individual deals on the position total in a grid cell.benchmark positions in tds.deployment of tds in canada. currency and volume uom conversions. implicit and explicit position break out issues.-- allan.ps colleen is setting up a meeting tomorrow to discuss the direction for transport. hopefully well know much better where that part stands at that point.
