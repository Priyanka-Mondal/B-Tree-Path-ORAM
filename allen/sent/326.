date wed  apr   - pdtgaryhere is a photograph of a similar house. the dimensions would be wide x  deep for the living area. in addition there will be a  deep two story porch across the entire back and  across the front. a modification to the front will be the addition of a gable across  on the left side. the living area will be brought forward under this gable to be flush with the front porch. i dont have my floor plan with me at work today but will bring in tomorrow and fax you a copy.phillip allen--pallenenron.com---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allenhouect on   pm ---------------------------hunter s shively  amcc
