date thu  jan   - pstquestions about  rentroll there were two deposits that were not labeled. one for  and the other for . which apartments a or  utility overages for  and  where did you get these amounts for what periods what is going on with . do not evict this tenant for being unclean that will just create an apartment that we will have to spend a lot of money and time remodeling. i would rather try and deal with this tenant by first asking them to clean their apartment and fixing anything that is wrong like leaky pipes. if that doesnt work we should tell them we will clean the apartment and charge them for the labor. then we will perform monthly inspections to ensure they are not damaging the property. this tenant has been here since september  i dont want to run them off.i check with the bank and i did not see that a deposit was made on tuesday so i couldnt check the total from the rentroll against the bank. is this right has the deposit been made yet a rentroll for jan th will follow shortly.phillip
