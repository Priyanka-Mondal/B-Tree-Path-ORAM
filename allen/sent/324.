date wed  apr   - pdt---------------------- forwarded by phillip k allenhouect on   pm ---------------------------ray alvarezenron  amcc phil i suspect that discussionsnegotiations are taking place behind closed doors in smoke filled rooms if not directly between commissioners then among ferc staffers. never say never but i think it is highly unlikely that the final order will contain a fixed price cap. i base this belief in large part on what i heard at a luncheon i attended yesterday afternoon at which the keynote speaker was ferc chairman curt hebert. although the chairman began his presentation by expressly stating that he would not comment or answer questions on pending proceedings before the commission hebert had some enlightening comments which relate to price capsprice caps are almost never the right answerprice caps will have the effect of prolonging shortagescompetitive choices for consumers is the right answerany solution however short term that does not increase supply or reduce demand is not acceptableeight out of eleven western governors oppose price caps in that they would export californias problems to the westthis is the latest intelligence i have on the matter and its a pretty strong anti- price cap position. of course hebert is just one commissioner out of  currently on the commission but he controls the meeting agenda and if the draft order is not to his liking the item could be bumped off the agenda. hope this info helps. rayphillip k allenect  pmcc are there behind closed doors discussions being held prior to the meeting is there the potential for a surprise announcement of some sort of fixed price gas or power cap once the open meeting finally happens
