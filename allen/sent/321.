date thu  apr   - pdtgaryi have also been speaking to johnnie brown in san antonio to be the general contractor. according to johnnie i would not be pay any less buying from the factory versus purchasing the panels through him since my site is within his region. assuming this is true i will work directly with him. i believe he has sent you my plans. they were prepared by kipp flores architects. can you confirm that the price is the same direct from the factory or from the distributor if you have the estimates worked up for johnnie will you please email them to me as wellthank you for your time. i am excited about potentially using your product.phillip allen
