reported third quarter net income of  million down  percent from  million in the same period a year ago. diluted earnings per share were . down  percent from a year ago. net revenues on a managed basis totaled . billion down one percent from . billion a year ago. the companys return on equity was . percent. results for the third quarter were negatively affected by two significant items a previously announced restructuring charge of  million pre-tax  million after-tax and the impacts from the september th terrorist attacks. the september th events resulted in certain one-time costs and business interruption losses including provisions related to credit exposures to travel industry service establishments insurance claims and waived finance charges and late fees. the combination of these items totaled approximately  million pre-tax  million after-tax. the company also incurred costs of approximately  million since september th which are expected to be covered by insurance. consequently these costs did not impact the quarterly results. these include the cost of duplicate facilities and equipment associated with the relocation of the companys offices in lower manhattan and certain other business recovery expenses. costs associated with the damage to the companys offices extra operating expenses and business interruption losses are still being evaluated. the company expects that a substantial portion ofgh its ists and losses will be covered by insurance. the third quarter restructuring charge includes severance costs for the elimination of approximately  jobs and asset impairment and other costs all relating to the consolidation and reorganization of certain business units the scale back of corporate lending in certain regions the migration of certain processes to lower cost locations the outsourcing of certain activities and the transition of certain processing and service functions to the internet. these initiatives are expected to produce expense savings of approximately  million in . a portion of these savings is expected to flow through to earnings in the form of improved operating expense margins and the rest is expected to be reinvested back into high-growth areas of the business. in addition to the activities related to the restructuring charge the company made strong progress on its global reengineering efforts initiated in the first half of the year and as of september  had realized savings in excess of  million.  net income for the third quarter adjusted for the restructuring and one-time costs related to september th was approximately  million down  percent. on a similar basis earnings per share were . down  percent. the companys adjusted return on equity was . percent. while we were on target to meet prior consensus for third quarter earnings the terrorist attacks obviously had a significant impact on the overall economy and we saw clear evidence of that as consumer spending business travel and investment activity slowed after september th said kenneth i. chenault chairman and chief executive officer american express company. in light of the weak economy and financial markets we are moving aggressively to lower our operating expenses. the progress we are making on our reengineering initiatives has freed up substantial resources for investment in our businesses with the strongest growth potential. this along with the anticipated benefit of lower interest rates and the strategies in place to grow our franchise positions us well to benefit when we see even a modest improvement in the economy. travel related services trs reported quarterly net income of  million down  percent from  million in the third quarter a year ago. included in third quarter results are  million pre-tax  million after-tax of the restructuring charge noted earlier. also included in the results are  million pre-tax  million after-tax of one-time costs and waived fees directly related to the september th terrorist attacks. excluding these costs and the restructuring charge trs net income would have been  million down  percent from the third quarter last year. trs net revenues rose two percent as growth in loans and fee revenues were partly offset by a three percent decline in billed business and a  percent fall in travel sales. these declines reflect a substantial decrease in corporate travel and entertainment spending and consumer travel since september th. prior to september billed business growth for the quarter was about two percent as higher consumer and small business spending offset a decline in corporate travel and entertainment spending. net finance charge revenues were higher due to balance growth and wider net interest yields. this increase reflects a smaller percentage of loan balances on introductory rates and the benefit of declining interest rates during the quarter. the provision for losses on the lending portfolios grew as a result of higher volumes and an increase in u.s. lending write-off rates and delinquencies. marketing and promotion expenses were lower as trs scaled back certain marketing efforts in light of the weaker business environment. operating expenses rose reflecting increased cardmember loyalty programs and business volumes. these expenses were partly offset by the benefits of reengineering and cost-control efforts. the above discussion presents trs results on a managed basis as if there had been no securitization transactions which conforms to industry practice. the attached financials present trs results on both a managed and reported basis. net income is the same in both formats. on a reported basis trs results included securitization gains of  million pre-tax  million after-tax and  million pre-tax  million after-tax in the third quarters of  and  respectively. these gains were offset by expenses related to card acquisition activities and therefore had no material impact on net income or total expenses. american express financial advisors aefa reported quarterly net income of  million down  percent from  million in the third quarter a year ago. net revenues decreased  percent. included in third quarter results are  million pre-tax  million after-tax of the restructuring charge noted earlier and  million pre-tax  million after-tax of insurance claims directly related to september th. excluding these items aefas net income would have been  million down  percent from last year. aefa results reflect continued weakness in equity markets and narrower spreads on the investment portfolio. the weakened equity markets led to significantly lower asset levels and lower sales of investment products. as a result management and distribution fees fell  percent. operating expenses excluding the above-mentioned charges decreased four percent from a year ago due primarily to lower sales commissions and continued reengineering and cost-control initiatives. as of september th approximately  percent of the companys  billion investment portfolio consisted of high-yield securities down from  percent a year ago and  percent last quarter. the reduction reflects the activities to date to lower the risk profile of the portfolio and concentrate on stronger credits. american express bank aeb reported a quarterly net loss of  million compared with  million of net income a year ago. included in third quarter results are  million pre-tax  million after-tax of the restructuring charge noted earlier. excluding these charges aebs net income would have been  million approximately double the earnings recorded in the same period last year. while aeb sustained damage to its premises due to the september th terrorist attacks the costs are expected to be covered by insurance. consequently these costs did not impact aebs quarterly results. aebs business results reflect strong performance in personal financial services and private banking. results also benefited from lower funding costs and lower operating expenses as a result of aebs reengineering efforts. these were offset in part by higher provisions for losses due to higher personal financial services loan balances and lower revenue from corporate banking as the company continues to shift its focus to personal financial services and private banking. corporate and other reported net expenses of  million compared with  million a year ago. included in third quarter  results are  million pre-tax  million after-tax of the restructuring charge noted earlier. american express company httpwww.americanexpress.com
